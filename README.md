# calculator
a javascript calculator

March 31, 2018

I forgot to upload this project to github in stages so the first commit will have all of the javascript finished however I still need to deal with the css. I might also add keyboard support. 
I added the basic functionality to the calculator plus decimal points and a backspce/delete function/button. 

To do list 
- fix css / make it look nice - finished March 31
- add a comment if someone tries to divide by zero - finished March 31
